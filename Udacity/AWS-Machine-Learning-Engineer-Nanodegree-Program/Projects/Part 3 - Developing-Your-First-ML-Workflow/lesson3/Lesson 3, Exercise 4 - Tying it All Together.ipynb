    "AWS is comprised of many services, and one of the main skills you'll develop as an ML Engineer working in AWS is in chaining these services together to accomplish specific data engineering goals. With Lambda, you've learned how to launch serverless jobs, and with Step Functions, you've learned how to create a workflow that chains jobs together. Now, you'll learn how to launch a Step Function using a Lambda job. "
